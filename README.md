# Assessment of bone invasion in oral cavity carcinoma

## Summary

The aim is to improve the preoperative assessment of bone invasion to reduce the risks of either over or under treament of the patient during surgery.


## Background

In head and neck cancer one of the biggest problems is to determine if a oral cavity tumor has invaded the bone structures, especially the manbible. The radiology assessment is often not a good predictor of this leading to excessive surgery with bone resection in some pateints where the bone could have been saved and also in some patients the risk of not resecting the entire tumor when the radiology had incorrectly indicated no bone invasion. 


## How is it used?
It will eventually if sucessful be used clinically by radiologists and surgeons for preoperative assessment of bone invasion or not in oral cavity cancer to decrease the risk of unnecessary morbidity and increase the proportions of complete resections.


## Data sources and AI methods

The data will be collected from the patients radiology examinations (Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography) and the post-surgery pathology reports for the same patients where it is determined if the tumor had invaded the bone or not. Reinforces machine learning for training sets will be the first step before evaluation of the method in real world test sets and compare the outcome with the radiologists assessment.

## Challenges

Since head and neck cancer is not one of the largest cancer groups in Sweden it could be a challenge to find enough training sets for machine learning. The project will need co-operating international head and neck cancer centres.

## What next?

The first thing is to the get Ethical approval for a pilot study at Örebro university hospital. If sucessful the next step is to set up an international multi centre study
